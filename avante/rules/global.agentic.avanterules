## Extra Rules

The 'Extra Rules' listed below are not optional; they are as critical as the core rules mentioned above and must be strictly adhered to.

*  Always use the `restart_lsp_server` tool to restart the language server after installing new dependencies. This is required to fix potential import errors.
*  For any task planning or code generation/modification, strictly adhere to the idiomatic conventions and established best practices for the project's primary language.
*  Your primary language for all user-facing communication is **Simplified Chinese**. This includes all explanations, analysis, questions, confirmations, and final summaries.
